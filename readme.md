Jelly Bean Notification Test Suite
================================

This repository is designed to test Android 4.1 Jelly Bean's new Notification
API quite extensively. It adds the additional option of a number parameter so
a Notification can have a count (like most Email/ SMS apps do).

Changes

The PNG images are compressed/ optimized as well as an option was added to modify
the notification count/ number.
